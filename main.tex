\section{Introduction}
This document provides detailed information on the collection of data on working conditions from the digitalized version of the third edition of the Dictionary of Occupational Titles (DOT) and its conversion to the European classification system ISCO-08. 
The Dictionary of Occupational Titles (DOT) was first published in 1939 and underwent four major updates: in 1949, 1965, 1977, and its final revision in 1991. Since then, it has been replaced by the Occupational Information Network (O*NET). The DOT is a comprehensive classification system of occupational information, which includes a wide range of variables, such as job titles, job descriptions, and occupational characteristics. The DOT was developed by the U.S. Department of Labor and was used for various purposes, such as job placement, vocational guidance, and labor market analysis.
