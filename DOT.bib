  abstract = {Several authors have successfully used the Dictionary of Occupational Titles to construct scales measuring occupational work environments. The Dictionary, however, has been replaced by the Occupation Information Network or O*NET, which offers expanded content and higher quality data. This paper reports an exploratory factor analysis of the O*NET (version 4.0). Four factors are identified. Three factors are comparable to the results of earlier analyses: substantive complexity, people versus things, and physical demands. A fourth factor, bureaucracy, is discovered that describes work in hierarchical organizations and oriented toward organizational policies and practices. O*NET variables and these factors can be linked to social studies via occupation codes and used as relatively objective and up to date assessments of work environments.},

The Revised Fourth   Edition is the result of ten years of research and verification by job   analysts across the nation. Each occupational definition systematically   presents the following seven basic parts: an occupational code number,   a title, an industry designation, alternate titles, a body of text   including a lead statement, task statements, glossary words, and   reference titles, undefined related titles, and a definition trailer.   The occupational code number and the definition trailer provide data   about a particular job's skill requirements, specific vocational  training requirements, and year last reviewed by an occupation analyst.},
